# ðŸ“Š Electronics & Appliance Sales Analysis (Power BI Project)

ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**

This project simulates a real-life analytics case for a multi-store consumer electronics & appliances retailer.  
The goal was to design an end-to-end BI solution: from raw CSV data cleaning and transformation to building an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps business users explore sales performance, customer behavior, and store efficiency.  

The dataset contained **~15,000 transactions** (2023â€“2025), including product, store, dealer, and customer information.  
After data preparation and modeling, the dashboard provides actionable insights into **top-performing products, seasonal demand, customer profiles, and payment method trends**.
